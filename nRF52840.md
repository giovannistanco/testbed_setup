The nRF52840 DK is a versatile single board development kit for Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary applications on the nRF52840 SoC. nRF52840 is an ultra-low power 2.4 GHz wireless system on chip (SoC) integrating a multiprotocol 2.4 GHz transceiver, an Arm® Cortex®-M4F CPU and flash program memory. It includes an NFC antenna that quickly enables utilization of the NFC-A tag peripheral. It is Arduino Uno Revision 3 compatible, making it possible to mount 3rd-party shields with ease.
The nRF52840 DK is a hardware development platform used to design and develop application firmware on the nRF52840 System on Chip (SoC). This kit can be used for developing for either the nRF52840 and nRF52811 SoCs.
When the device is connected to the PC, it will appear on Windows Explorer as a removable drive named JLINK. 
It is then necessary to download and setup the software tools that helps developing and testing in the software development cycle. 
The first thing to install is a development IDE. SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES) is the recommened platform for an IDE with a compiler supported by Nordic. SES is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for microcontrollers specifically designed to provide users with everything needed for professional embedded C programming and development. Run the installer as administrator in order to install SES on your Windows computer.
The second tool to install is the Nordic SDK, that includes a broad selection of drivers, libraries, examples for peripherals, SoftDevices, and proprietary radio protocols.
The nRF52840 DK is a hardware development platform used to design and develop application firmware on the nRF52840 System on Chip (SoC).
Another essential tool to install is the SDK (Software Development Kit). The SDK is delivered as a .zip-archive, which makes it easy to install. The versione we choos to install is the latest, nRF5_SDK_17.1.0_ddde560. The install.txt provides information about the installation. The first instruction is to unzip the file. It does not work properly, it may take a while and may cause problems to Windows Explorer. The msi file inside the extracted directorly installs the nRF MDK (microcontroller development kit) for IAR. 



The first example to test is a Heart Rate Monitor application provided by Nordic. The demo can be downloaded from the website and it comes with a readme file containing the instructions.
