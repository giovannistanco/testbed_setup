The nRF52840 DK is a versatile single board development kit for Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary applications on the nRF52840 SoC. nRF52840 is an ultra-low power 2.4 GHz wireless system on chip (SoC) integrating a multiprotocol 2.4 GHz transceiver, an Arm® Cortex®-M4F CPU and flash program memory. It includes an NFC antenna that quickly enables utilization of the NFC-A tag peripheral. It is Arduino Uno Revision 3 compatible, making it possible to mount 3rd-party shields with ease.
The nRF52840 DK is a hardware development platform used to design and develop application firmware on the nRF52840 System on Chip (SoC). This kit can be used for developing for either the nRF52840 and nRF52811 SoCs.
When the device is connected to the PC, it will appear on Windows Explorer as a removable drive named JLINK. 
It is then necessary to download and setup the software tools that helps developing and testing in the software development cycle. SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES) is the recommened platform for an IDE with a compiler supported by Nordic. SES is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for microcontrollers specifically designed to provide users with everything needed for professional embedded C programming and development.






The first example to test is a Heart Rate Monitor application provided by Nordic. The demo can be downloaded from the website and it comes with a readme file containing the instructions.
